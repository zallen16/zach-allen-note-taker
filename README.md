# zach-allen-note-taker

Starter code was given out, and us students were tasked with creating the back-end to utilize Express.js and send and receive data from a JSON file all for the purpose of writing and saving notes. A vital part of this challenge is to showcase the importance of using a JSON with Express for the useful function of storing actual data on our own JSON database file. While the application itself is simple, it fully implements the intended use of storing the db.json ourselves rather than exposing it, with the help of Express of course. Application was deployed using Render software.

Help for assignment was given by tutor Bobbi Tarkany and TAs of bootcamp.
